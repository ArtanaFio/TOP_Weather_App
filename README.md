# TOP_Weather_App

<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Odin Project Weather App project</a> focusing on fetch API. The project used weather data from Visual Crossing API.

## Project Goals

- Create functions that hit the API to take a location and return weather data for that location.
- The functions should process the JSON data from the API and return an object with only data required for the weather app.
- The app should include a form to allow users to enter a location and that will fetch the weather information.
- Display the weather information in the user interface.
- Allow the user to toggle temperature data between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
- The user interface appearance should change depending on the weather data, in this case using weather icons and color schemes.

## Note About API Keys and Security

While we acknowledge that API keys should be stored on the server and never be exposed in the frontend, this project is currently solely focused on fetching API data from a publically available API. Therefore there are no real security risks or any real consequence in doing so.
